                <p>
                        I don't like your little games<br>
                        Don't like your tilted stage<br>
                        The role you made me play<br>
                        Of the fool, no, I don't like you<br>
                        <br>
                        I don't like your perfect crime<br>
                        How you laugh when you lie<br>
                        You said the gun was mine<br>
                        Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh!)<br>
                        <br>
                        But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time<br>
                        Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time<br>
                        I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined<br>
                        I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!<br>
                        <br>
                        Ooh, look what you made me do<br>
                        Look what you made me do<br>
                        Look what you just made me do<br>
                        Look what you just made me<br>
                        Ooh, look what you made me do<br>
                        Look what you made me do<br>
                        Look what you just made me do<br>
                        Look what you just made me do<br>
                        <br>
                        I don't like your kingdom keys<br>
                        They once belonged to me<br>
                        You asked me for a place to sleep<br>
                        Locked me out and threw a feast (what?)<br>
                        <br>
                        The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama<br>
                        But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma<br>
                        And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure<br>
                        Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours<br>
                        <br>
                        But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time (nick of time)<br>
                        Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time (I do it all the time)<br>
                        I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined<br>
                        I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!<br>

                        I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me<br>
                        I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams<br>
                        I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me<br>

                        I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now<br>
                        Why?<br>
                        Oh, 'cause she's dead! (Ohh!)<br>
