                <p>
                        See you in the dark<br>
                        All eyes on you, my magician<br>
                        All eyes on us<br>
                        You make everyone disappear, and<br>
                        Cut me into pieces<br>
                        Gold cage, hostage to my feelings<br>
                        Back against the wall<br>
                        Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone<br>
                        <br>
                        'Cause we breakdown a little<br>
                        But when you get me alone, it's so simple<br>
                        'Cause baby, I know what you know<br>
                        We can feel it<br>
                        <br>
                        And all our pieces fall<br>
                        Right into place<br>
                        Getting caught up in a moment<br>
                        Lipstick on your face<br>
                        So it goes<br>
                        I'm yours to keep<br>
                        And I'm yours to lose<br>
                        You know I'm not a bad girl, but I<br>
                        Do bad things with you<br>
                        So it goes<br>
                        <br>
                        Met you in a bar<br>
                        All eyes on me, your illusionist<br>
                        All eyes on us<br>
                        I make all your gray days clear, and<br>
                        I wear you like a necklace<br>
                        I'm so chill but you make me jealous<br>
                        But I got your heart<br>
                        Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone<br>
                        <br>
                        'Cause we breakdown a little<br>
                        But when I get you alone, it's so simple<br>

                        So, so, so it goes<br>
                        Scratches down your back now<br>
                        So, so, so it goes<br>
                        <br>
                        You did a number on me<br>
                        But, honestly, baby, who's counting?<br>
                        I did a number on you<br>

                        <br>
                        And all our pieces fall (pieces fall)<br>

                        Getting caught up in a moment (caught up, caught up)<br>

                        So it goes<br>
                        I'm yours to keep (oh)<br>
