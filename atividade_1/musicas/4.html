                <p> 
                        Don't blame me, love made me crazy<br>
                        If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right<br>
                        Lord, save me, my drug is my baby<br>
                        I'll be using for the rest of my life<br>
                        <br>
                        I've been breaking hearts a long time<br>
                        And toying with them older guys<br>
                        Just playthings for me to use<br>
                        Something happened for the first time<br>
                        In the darkest little paradise<br>
                        Shaking, pacing, I just need you<br>
                        <br>
                        For you, I would cross the line<br>
                        I would waste my time<br>
                        I would lose my mind<br>
                        They say: She's gone too far this time<br>
                        <br>
                        Don't blame me, love made me crazy<br>
                        If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right<br>
                        Lord, save me, my drug is my baby<br>
                        I'll be using for the rest of my life<br>
                        Don't blame me, love made me crazy<br>
                        If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right<br>
                        Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby<br>
                        I'll be using for the rest of my life<br>
                        <br>
                        My name is whatever you decide<br>
                        And I'm just gonna call you mine<br>
                        I'm insane, but I'm your baby<br>
                        Echoes of your name inside my mind<br>
                        Halo, hiding my obsession<br>
                        I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy<br>
                        <br>
                        And, baby, for you, I would fall from grace<br>
                        Just to touch your face<br>
                        If you walk away<br>
                        I'd beg you on my knees to stay<br>
                        <br>
                        Don't blame me, love made me crazy<br>
                        If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right<br>
                        Lord, save me, my drug is my baby<br>
                        I'll be using for the rest of my life<br>
                        Don't blame me, love made me crazy<br>
                        If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right<br>
                        Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby<br>
                        I'll be using for the rest of my life<br>
                        <br>
                        I get so high (oh!)<br>
                        Every time you're, every time you're loving me<br>
                        You're loving me<br>
                        Trip of my life (oh!)<br>
                        Every time you're, every time you're touching me<br>
                        You're touching me<br>
                        Every time you're, every time you're loving me<br>
                        Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby<br>
                        I'll be using for the rest of my life<br>
                        Using for the rest of my life, oh<br>
                        <br>
                        Don't blame me, love made me crazy<br>
                        If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right<br>
                        Lord, save me, my drug is my baby<br>
                        I'll be using for the rest of my life<br>
                        Don't blame me, love made me crazy<br>
                        If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right<br>

                        <br>
                        I get so high (oh!)<br>
