                        Just another ex-love you don’t wanna see<br>
                        I don’t wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)<br>
                        Like the other girls do<br>
                        I don’t wanna hurt you, I just wanna be<br>

                        I know what they all say (I know what they all say)<br>

                        I wanna be your end game (end game)<br>
                        I wanna be your first string (first string)<br>

                        [Ed Sheeran]<br>
                        Knew her when I was young<br>
                        Reconnected when we were little bit older, both sprung<br>
                        I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders<br>
                        Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep<br>
                        The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me<br>
                        Even when we’d argue, we'd not do it for long<br>
                        And you understand the good and bad end up in the song<br>
                        For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease<br>
                        For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities<br>
                        I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny<br>
                        After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July<br>
                        I've passed days without fun, this endgame is the one<br>
                        With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it<br>

                        I hit you like, bang! We tried to forget it, but we just couldn't<br>
                        And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em<br>
                        Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy<br>
                        I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me<br>
                        And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul<br>
                        It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold<br>
                        You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks<br>
                        So here's the truth from my red lips<br>
