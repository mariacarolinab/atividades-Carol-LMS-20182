                <p>
                        This ain't for the best<br>
                        My reputation's never been worse, so<br>
                        You must like me for me<br>
                        We can't make<br>
                        Any promises now, can we, babe?<br>
                        But you can make me a drink<br>
                        <br>
                        Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?<br>
                        Phone lights up my nightstand in the black<br>
                        Come here, you can meet me in the back<br>
                        Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you<br>
                        Oh, damn, never seen that color blue<br>
                        Just think of the fun things we could do<br>
                        <br>
                        ('Cause I like you)<br>

                        Is it cool that I said all that?<br>
                        Is it chill that you're in my head?<br>
                        'Cause I know that it's delicate<br>
                        (Delicate)<br>

                        Is it too soon to do this yet?<br>
                        'Cause I know that it's delicate<br>

                        Third floor on the West Side, me and you<br>
                        Handsome, you're a mansion with a view<br>
                        Do the girls back home touch you like I do?<br>
                        Long night, with your hands up in my hair<br>
                        Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs<br>
                        Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share<br>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        Sometimes I wonder when you sleep<br>
                        Are you ever dreaming of me?<br>
                        Sometimes when I look into your eyes<br>
                        I pretend you're mine all the damn time<br>
