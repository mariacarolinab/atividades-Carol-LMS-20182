                        Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted  <br>
                        But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom <br>
                        Holding him for ransom, some <br>
                        Some boys are trying too hard, he don't try at all, though <br>
                        Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so <br>
                        I see nothing better, I keep him forever <br>

                        Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me <br>
                        Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry <br>
                        But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist <br>
                        And we'll move to an island, and <br>
