                <p>
                        Gorgeous <br>
                        <br>
                        You should take it as a compliment<br>
                        That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk<br>
                        You should think about the consequence<br>
                        Of your magnetic field being a little too strong<br>
                        <br>
                        And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us<br>
                        He's in the club doing I don't know what<br>
                        You're so cool it makes me hate you so much<br>
                        (I hate you so much)<br>
                        <br>
                        Whiskey on ice, Sunset and Vine<br>
                        You've ruined my life by not being mine<br>
                        <br>
                        You're so gorgeous<br>
                        I can't say anything to your face<br>
                        'Cause look at your face<br>
                        And I'm so furious<br>
                        At you for making me feel this way<br>
                        But what can I say?<br>
                        You're gorgeous<br>
                        <br>
                        You should take it as a compliment<br>
                        That I'm talking to everyone here but you<br>
                        (But you, but you)<br>
                        And you should think about the consequence<br>
                        Of you touching my hand in the darkened room<br>
                        (Dark room, dark room)<br>
                        <br>
                        If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her<br>
                        But if you're single that's honestly worse<br>
                        'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts<br>
                        (Honey, it hurts)<br>
                        <br>
                        Ocean blue eyes lookin' in mine<br>
                        I feel like I might sink and drown and die<br>
                        <br>
                        You're so gorgeous<br>
                        I can't say anything to your face (to your face)<br>
                        'Cause look at your face (look at your face)<br>
                        And I'm so furious<br>
                        At you for making me feel this way (feel this way)<br>
                        But what can I say?<br>
                        You're gorgeous<br>
                        <br>
                        You make me so happy it turns back to sad, yeah<br>
                        There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have<br>
                        And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad<br>
                        You make me so happy it turns back to sad, yeah<br>
                        There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have<br>
                        Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats<br>
                        Alone<br>
                        Unless you wanna come along<br>
                        <br>
                        You're so gorgeous<br>
