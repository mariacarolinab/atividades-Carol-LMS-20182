                <p>
                        I, I loved you in secret<br>
                        First sight, yeah, we love without reason<br>
                        Oh, twenty-five years old<br>
                        Oh, how were you to know? And<br>
                        My, my love had been frozen<br>
                        Deep blue, but you painted me golden<br>
                        Oh, and you held me close<br>
                        Oh, how was I to know? I<br>
                        <br>
                        I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets<br>
                        Picture of your face in an invisible locket<br>
                        You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it<br>
                        I had a bad feeling<br>
                        And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis<br>
                        People started talking, putting us through our paces<br>
                        I knew there was no one in the world who could take it<br>
                        I had a bad feeling<br>
                        <br>
                        But we were dancing<br>
                        Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied<br>
                        Yeah, we were dancing<br>
                        Like it was the first time, first time<br>
                        Yeah, we were dancing<br>
                        Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied<br>
                        Yeah, we were dancing<br>
                        And I had a bad feeling<br>
                        But we were dancing<br>
                        <br>
                        I, I loved you in spite of<br>
                        Deep fears that the world would divide us<br>
                        So baby, can we dance?<br>
                        Oh, through an avalanche? And<br>
                        Say, say that we got it<br>
                        I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted<br>
                        Oh, 'cause it's gravity<br>
                        Oh, keeping you with me, I<br>
                        <br>
                        I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets<br>
                        Picture of your face in an invisible locket<br>
                        You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it<br>
                        I had a bad feeling<br>
                        <br>
                        But we were dancing<br>
                        Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied<br>
                        Yeah, we were dancing<br>

                        And I had a bad feeling<br>
                        But we were dancing<br>
                        <br>
                        I'd kiss you as the lights went out<br>
                        Swaying as the room burned down<br>
                        I'd hold you as the water rushes in<br>
                        If I could dance with you again<br>
                        I'd kiss you as the lights went out<br>
                        Swaying as the room burned down<br>
                        I'd hold you as the water rushes in<br>
                        If I could dance with you again<br>
                        <br>
