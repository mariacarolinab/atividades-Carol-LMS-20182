                <p>
                        Our secret moments in a crowded room<br>
                        They got no idea about me and you<br>
                        There is an indentation in the shape of you<br>
                        Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo<br>
                        <br>
                        All of this silence and patience<br>
                        Pining and anticipation<br>
                        My hands are shaking from holding back from you, ah-ah-ah<br>
                        All of this silence and patience<br>
                        Pining and desperately waiting<br>
                        My hands are shaking from all this, ah-ah-ah-ah<br>
                        <br>
                        Say my name and everything just stops<br>
                        I don't want you like a best friend<br>
                        Only bought this dress so you could take it off<br>
                        Take it o-o-o-off<br>
                        Carve your name into my bedpost<br>
                        ’Cause I don't want you like a best friend<br>
                        Only bought this dress so you could take it off<br>
                        Take it o-o-o-off<br>
                        <br>
                        Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try<br>
                        And if I get burned, at least we were electrified<br>
                        I’m spilling wine in the bathtub<br>
                        You kiss my face and we're both drunk<br>
                        Everyone thinks that they know us<br>
                        But they know nothing about<br>
                        <br>
                        All of this silence and patience<br>
                        Pining and anticipation<br>
                        My hands are shaking from holding back from you, ah-ah-ah<br>
                        All of this silence and patience<br>

                        My hands are shaking from all this, ah-ah-ah-ah<br>
                        <br>
                        Say my name and everything just stops<br>

                        <br>
                        Ah, ah, ahh<br>
                        Only bought this dress so you could take it off<br>
                        Ah, ah, ahh<br>
                        Only bought this dress so you could take it off<br>
                        <br>
                        Flashback when you met me<br>
                        Your buzzcut and my hair bleached<br>
                        Even in my worst times, you could see the best of me<br>
                        Flashback to my mistakes<br>
                        My rebounds, my earthquakes<br>
                        Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me<br>
                        <br>
                        And I woke up just in time<br>
                        Now I wake up by your side<br>
                        My one and only, my lifeline<br>
                        I woke up just in time<br>
                        Now I wake up by your side<br>
                        My hands shake, I can't explain this, ah-ah-ah-ah<br>
                        <br>
                        Say my name and everything just stops<br>
                        I don't want you like a best friend<br>
