                <p>     I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own <br>
                        I made up my mind<br>
                        I'm better off being alone<br>
                        We met a few weeks ago<br>
                        Now you try on calling me 'baby'<br>
                        Like trying on clothes<br>
                        <br>
                        Salute to me, I'm your American Queen<br>
                        And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat<br>
                        And we rule the kingdom inside my room<br>
                        'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars<br>
                        With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars<br>
                        Never took me quite where you do<br>
                        <br>
                        And all at once, you are the one<br>
                        I have been waiting for<br>
                        King of my heart<br>
                        Body and soul, woah<br>
                        And all at once, you're all I want<br>
                        I'll never let you go<br>
                        King of my heart<br>
                        Body and soul, woah<br>
                        <br>
                        And all at once<br>
                        I've been waiting, waiting<br>
                        Woah, woah<br>
                        And all at once, you are the one<br>
                        I have been waiting, waiting<br>
                        Body and soul, woah<br>
                        And all at once<br>
                        <br>
                        Late in the night, the city's asleep<br>
                        Your love is a secret<br>
                        I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep<br>
                        Change my priorities<br>
                        The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury<br>
                        <br>
                        Salute to me, I'm your American Queen<br>
                        And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat<br>
                        And we rule the kingdom inside my room (inside my room, oh)<br>
                        'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars<br>
                        With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars<br>
                        Never took me quite where you do (where you do)<br>
                        <br>
                        And all at once, you are the one<br>
                        I have been waiting for<br>
                        King of my heart<br>
                        Body and soul, woah<br>
                        And all at once, you're all I want<br>
                        I'll never let you go<br>
                        King of my heart (my heart)<br>
                        Body and soul, woah<br>
                        <br>
                        And all at once (hey)<br>
                        I've been waiting, waiting (waiting)<br>
                        Woah, woah<br>
                        And all at once, you are the one<br>
                        I have been waiting (waiting), waiting (waiting)<br>
                        Body and soul, woah<br>
                        And all at once<br>
                        <br>
                        Is this end of all the endings?<br>
                        My broken bones are mending<br>
                        With all these nights we're spending<br>
                        Up on the roof with a school girl crush<br>
                        Drinking beer out of plastic cups<br>
                        Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff<br>
                        Baby, all at once, this is enough<br>
                        <br>
                        And all at once, you are the one<br>
                        I have been waiting for<br>
                        King of my heart<br>
                        Body and soul, woah<br>
                        <br>
                        And all at once, you are the one<br>
                        I have been waiting for<br>
                        King of my heart<br>
                        Body and soul, woah<br>
                        And all at once, you're all I want<br>
                        I'll never let you go<br>
                        King of my heart (my heart)<br>
                        Body and soul (my soul), woah<br>
                        <br>
                        And all at once<br>
                        I've been waiting, waiting
                        Woah, woah
                        And all at once, you are the one
                        I have been waiting, waiting
                        Body and soul, woah
