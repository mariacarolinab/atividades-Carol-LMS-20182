                <p>
                        My castle crumbled overnight <br>
                        I brought a knife to a gun fight<br>
                        They took the crown, but it's alright<br>
                        All the liars are calling me one<br>
                        Nobody's heard from me for months<br>
                        I'm doing better than I ever was<br>
                        'Cause<br>
                        <br>
                        My baby's fit like a daydream<br>
                        Walking with his head down<br>
                        I'm the one he's walking to<br>
                        So call it what you want, yeah<br>
                        Call it what you want to<br>
                        My baby's fly like a jet stream<br>
                        High above the whole scene<br>
                        Loves me like I'm brand new<br>
                        So call it what you want, yeah<br>
                        Call it what you want to<br>
                        <br>
                        All my flowers grew back as thorns<br>
                        Windows boarded up after the storm<br>
                        He built a fire just to keep me warm<br>
                        All the drama queens taking swings<br>
                        All the jokers dressing up as kings<br>
                        They fade to nothing when I look at him<br>
                        <br>
                        And I know I make the same mistakes every time<br>
                        Bridges burn, I never learn<br>
                        At least I did one thing right<br>
                        I did one thing right<br>
                        I'm laughing with my lover<br>
                        Making forts under covers<br>
                        Trust him like a brother<br>
                        Yeah, you know I did one thing right<br>
                        Starry eyes sparking up my darkest night<br>
                        <br>
                        My baby's fit like a daydream<br>
                        Walking with his head down<br>
                        I'm the one he's walking to<br>
                        So call it what you want, yeah<br>
                        Call it what you want to<br>
                        My baby's fly like a jet stream<br>
                        High above the whole scene<br>
                        Loves me like I'm brand new<br>
                        (Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)<br>
                        So call it what you want, yeah<br>
                        Call it what you want to<br>
                        <br>
                        I want to wear his initial<br>
                        On a chain 'round my neck, chain 'round my neck<br>
                        Not because he owns me<br>
                        But 'cause he really knows me<br>
                        Which is more than they can say<br>
                        I recall late November<br>
                        Holding my breath, slowly I said<br>
                        You don't need to save me<br>
                        But would you run away with me?<br>
                        Yes!<br>
                        <br>
                        My baby's fit like a daydream<br>
                        Walking with his head down<br>
                        I'm the one he's walking to<br>
                        (Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)<br>
                        So call it what you want, yeah<br>
