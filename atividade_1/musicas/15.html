                <p>
                        There's glitter on the floor after the party <br>
                        Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby<br>
                        Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor<br>
                        You and me from the night before, but<br>
                        <br>
                        Don’t read the last page<br>
                        But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared<br>
                        And you’re turning away<br>
                        I want your midnights<br>
                        But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you<br>
                        On New Year's Day<br>
                        <br>
                        You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi<br>
                        I can tell that it's gonna be a long road<br>
                        I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe<br>
                        Or if you strike out and you're crawling home<br>
                        <br>
                        Don't read the last page<br>
                        But I stay when it’s hard or it’s wrong<br>
                        Or we're making mistakes<br>
                        I want your midnights<br>
                        But I’ll be cleaning up bottles with you<br>
                        On New Year's Day<br>
                        <br>
                        Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you<br>
                        Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you<br>
                        Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you<br>
                        And I will hold on to you<br>
                        <br>
                        Please, don't ever become a stranger<br>
                        Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere<br>
                        Please, don't ever become a stranger<br>
                        Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere<br>
