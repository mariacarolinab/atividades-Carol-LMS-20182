                <p>
                        I never trust a narcissist, but they love me<br>
                        So I play 'em like a violin<br>
                        And I make it look, oh so easy<br>
                        'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three<br>
                        This is how the world works<br>
                        Now all he thinks about is me<br>
                        <br>
                        I can feel the flames on my skin<br>
                        Crimson red paint on my lips<br>
                        If a man talks shit then I owe him nothing<br>
                        I don't regret it one bit 'cause he had it coming<br>
                        <br>
                        They say I did something bad<br>
                        Then why's it feel so good?<br>
                        They say I did something bad<br>
                        Then why's it feel so good?<br>
                        Most fun I ever had<br>
                        And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could<br>
                        It just felt so good, good<br>
                        <br>
                        I never trust a playboy, but they love me<br>
                        So I fly 'em all around the world<br>
                        And I let them think they saved me<br>
                        They never see it coming what I do next<br>
                        This is how the world works<br>
                        You gotta leave before you get left<br>
                        <br>
                        I can feel the flames on my skin<br>
                        He says: Don't throw away a good thing<br>
                        But if he drops my name then I owe him nothing<br>
                        And if he spends my change then he had it coming<br>
                        <br>

                        It just felt so good<br>
                        <br>
                        They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one<br>
                        They got their pitchforks and proof<br>
                        Their receipts and reasons<br>
                        They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one<br>
                        So light me up, light me up, light me up<br>
                        Go ahead and light me up<br>
                        Light me up, light me up, light me up, light me up<br>
