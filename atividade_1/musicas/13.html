                <p>
                        It was so nice throwing big parties<br>
                        Jumping into the pool from the balcony<br>
                        Everyone swimming in a champagne sea<br>
                        And there are no rules when you show up here<br>
                        Bass beat rattling the chandelier<br>
                        Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year<br>
                        <br>
                        So why'd you have to rain on my parade?<br>
                        I'm shaking my head, I'm locking the gates<br>
                        <br>
                        This is why we can't have nice things, dar-ling<br>
                        Because you break them, I had to take them away<br>
                        This is why we can't have nice things, ho-ney<br>
                        Oh, did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?<br>
                        This is why we can't have nice things<br>
                        <br>
                        It was so nice being friends again<br>
                        There I was giving you a second chance<br>
                        But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand<br>
                        And therein lies the issue, friends don't try to trick you<br>
                        Get you on the phone and mind-twist you<br>
                        And so I took an axe to a mended fence<br>
                        <br>
                        But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately<br>
                        Uh-uh, if only you weren't so shady<br>
                        <br>
                        This is why we can't have nice things, dar-ling (yeah)<br>
                        Because you break them, I had to take them away<br>
                        This is why we can't have nice (nice things) things (baby), ho-ney<br>
                        Oh, did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?<br>
                        This is why we can't have<br>
                        <br>
                        Here's a toast to my real friends<br>
                        They don't care about that he said, she said<br>
                        And here's to my baby<br>
                        He ain't reading what they call me lately<br>
                        And here's to my momma<br>
                        Had to listen to all this drama<br>
                        And here's to you<br>
                        â€˜Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do<br>
                        Hahaha, I can't even say it with a straight face!<br>
                        <br>
                        This is why we can't have nice things, dar-ling (darling)<br>
                        Because you break them, I had to take them away<br>
                        This is why we can't have nice (uh-uh) things (oh no), ho-ney (baby)<br>
                        Oh, did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?<br>
                        <br>
                        This is why we can't have nice things, dar-ling<br>

                        (And here's to my baby)<br>
                        Nice things, ho-ney<br>
                        (They didn't care about that he said, she said)<br>
