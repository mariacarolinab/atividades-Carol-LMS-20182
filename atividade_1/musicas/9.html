                <p>(No, nothing good starts in a getaway car) <br>
                    <br>
                        It was the best of times, the worst of crimes<br>
                        I struck a match and blew your mind<br>
                        But I didn't mean it<br>
                        And you didn’t see it<br>
                        The ties were black, the lies were white<br>
                        In shades of gray in candlelight<br>
                        I wanted to leave him<br>
                        I needed a reason<br>
                        <br>
                        X marks the spot where we fell apart<br>
                        He poisoned the well, I was lying to myself<br>
                        I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed<br>
                        We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (oh!)<br>
                        <br>
                        You were driving the getaway car<br>
                        We were flying, but we'd never get far<br>
                        Don't pretend it's such a mystery<br>
                        Think about the place where you first met me<br>
                        Riding in a getaway car<br>
                        There were sirens in the beat of your heart<br>
                        Should've known I'd be the first to leave<br>
                        Think about the place where you first met me<br>
                        <br>
                        In a getaway car (oh, whoa)<br>
                        No, they never get far (oh, whoa)<br>
                        No, nothing good starts in a getaway car<br>
                        <br>
                        It was the great escape, the prison break<br>
                        The light of freedom on my face<br>
                        But you weren't thinking<br>
                        And I was just drinking<br>
                        Well, he was running after us, I was screaming: Go, go, go!<br>
                        But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow<br>
                        And a circus ain’t a love story<br>
                        And now we're both sorry<br>
                        (We're both sorry)<br>
                        <br>
                        X marks the spot where we fell apart<br>
                        He poisoned the well, every man for himself<br>
                        I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed<br>
                        It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (oh!)<br>
                        <br>
                        You were driving the getaway car<br>
                        We were flying, but we'd never get far<br>

                        No, they never get far (oh, whoa)<br>
                        No, nothing good starts in a getaway car<br>
                        <br>
                        We were jet-set Bonnie and Clyde<br>
                        Until I switched to the other side, to the other side<br>
                        It's no surprise, I turned you in<br>
                        'Cause us, traitors, never win<br>
                        <br>
                        I'm in a getaway car<br>
                        I left you in a motel bar<br>
                        Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys<br>
                        That was the last time you ever saw me (oh!)<br>
                        <br>
                        Driving the getaway car<br>
                        We were flying, but we'd never get far (don't pretend)<br>

                        I was riding in a getaway car<br>
                        I was crying in a getaway car<br>
                        I was dying in a getaway car<br>
                        Said 'goodbye' in a getaway car<br>
